## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT


## PROJECT : MITRE ATT&CK BASED CYBER ATTACK DETECTION SYSTEM



## OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE


### Primary Objective

To design and implement a fully functional, professional-grade cybersecurity operations platform that demonstrates end-to-end capability in real-time threat detection, automated incident response, and compliance reporting—serving both as a practical security tool and an advanced portfolio showcase of elite defensive skills.

---

## WHAT PROBLEM WE SOLVED?

### Before Project:

- Security monitoring was often manual, slow, and reactive, leading to delayed threat detection.
- Incident response relied heavily on human intervention, increasing mean time to respond (MTTR) and risk.
- Compliance reporting was a tedious, post-incident manual process, prone to inconsistency.
- Learning cybersecurity operations was largely theoretical—without hands-on experience in a realistic, integrated environment.
- Security practitioners lacked a tangible, portfolio-ready demonstration of end-to-end defensive capabilities.

### After Project:

- Real-time detection & monitoring is automated, with centralized log aggregation and correlation.
- Automated incident response reduces MTTR through predefined playbooks for containment and remediation.
- Compliance-ready reports are generated automatically in standardized formats (e.g., PDF, HTML), ready for audits.
- Hands-on education is built-in: users learn by interacting with a real SOC-like platform and guided security scenarios.
- Professional proof of skill is established through a documented, deployable platform that showcases real-world cybersecurity competency.

## REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS

This platform is designed to address practical security challenges in modern environments:

- **SOC Operations:** Acts as a lightweight Security Operations Center (SOC) for continuous monitoring, alerting, and incident response.
- **Compliance & Auditing:** Automates evidence collection and report generation for standards such as NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR, SOC 2, and PCI-DSS.
- **Threat Hunting & Forensics:** Provides a centralized log analysis environment for proactive threat hunting and post-incident forensic investigation.
- **Security Training & Drills:** Serves as a lab environment for training cybersecurity teams, conducting red/blue team exercises, or onboarding new analysts.
- **DevSecOps Integration:** Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to monitor build environments, container activity, and cloud deployments for security anomalies.
- **Small/Medium Business Security:** Offers an affordable, in-house security monitoring solution for organizations without a dedicated SOC.

### Who Would Use This System?

- **Security Analysts & SOC Engineers** – For daily monitoring, investigation, and response workflows.
- **Cybersecurity Students & Learners** – To gain hands-on experience with real tools, logs, and scenarios in a safe environment.
- **IT & System Administrators** – To enhance visibility into network and system activities and respond to incidents faster.
- **Compliance Officers & Auditors** – To generate standardized security reports and maintain audit trails efficiently.
- **Cybersecurity Job Seekers** – As a portfolio project that demonstrates practical skills in detection, automation, and reporting to potential employers.
- **Security Consultants & Freelancers** – To deploy for clients needing interim or project-based monitoring and reporting capabilities.
- **CTF & Competition Participants** – As a platform to practice defensive security challenges in a controlled setting.

### What does the System Detects?

This platform is configured to identify and alert on a wide range of security events, including:

**Threat Detection**

- Suspicious network traffic (port scans, brute-force attacks, unusual outbound connections)
- Malware & ransomware indicators (known hashes, behavior patterns, fileless malware artifacts)
- Unauthorized access attempts (failed logins, privilege escalation, lateral movement)
- Data exfiltration signals (large outbound transfers, abnormal protocols, DNS tunneling)
- Anomalous user behavior (off-hours activity, geographic irregularities, excessive data access)

**System & Log Alerts**

- Log tampering or deletion (Syslog/Event Log anomalies)
- Unapproved configuration changes (firewall rules, user accounts, service modifications)
- Resource misuse (CPU spikes from cryptomining, memory exhaustion attacks)
- Endpoint security events (AV alerts, USB device insertions, unauthorized software)

**Cloud & Container Threats**

- Misconfigured cloud storage (public S3 buckets, open security groups)
- Container escape attempts and unauthorized cluster access
- Cloud credential abuse and IAM policy violations

2. Automated Analysis
   
   - Applies detection rules (signature + behavior-based) to identify threats
   - Uses threat intelligence feeds to enrich alerts with contextual data (IP/Domain reputation, malware info)

3. Incident Response Automation
   
   - Executes predefined playbooks to:
   - Isolate compromised endpoints
   - Block malicious IPs at the firewall
   - Disable user accounts
   - Quarantine suspicious files
   - Notifies security teams via email, Slack, or ticketing systems

4. Forensics & Investigation

   - Provides searchable log storage with retention policies
   - Generates visual attack chain diagrams

5. Compliance & Reporting

  Produces scheduled/on-demand reports for:
   - Daily security posture summaries
   - Incident response documentation
   - Compliance audit evidence (PDF/HTML/CSV formats)

6. Education & Demonstration

   - Includes training modules with guided attack/defense scenarios
   - Documents architecture and detection logic for learning purposes
   - Serves as a portfolio-ready demonstration of defensive security skills
